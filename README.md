nCrypt is a simple utility used to encrypt or decrypt single files with a password. nCrypt uses the AES-256 encryption algorithm making it text book secure. nCrypt can be used for secure file transfers, keeping things locked up on your personal or work computer, or even to partake in some mischievous behavior. All uses aside, nCrypt is simple and easy to use.
